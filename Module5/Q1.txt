Why Django should be used for web-development? Explain how you can create a project in Django?

-> Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. 
Here are some key reasons why Django should be used for web development:

Batteries-Included Framework:

Django comes with a lot of built-in features that make web development easier and faster. It includes an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper), 
authentication, URL routing, template engine, and more.

Security:
Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid common security mistakes such as SQL injection, 
cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery, and clickjacking. It includes security features out-of-the-box.

Scalability:
Django is designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible and handle a high load as they grow. 
It has a "shared-nothing" architecture, which means you can add hardware at any level.

Admin Interface:
Django automatically generates an admin interface for your models, allowing you to manage your application data without additional effort. 
This feature is very useful for quick administrative tasks.

Community and Documentation:
Django has a large and active community, and it’s well-documented. There are many resources, tutorials, and third-party packages available.

Versatility:
Django is suitable for a wide range of web applications, from simple websites to complex, high-traffic web applications.

Creating a Django project involves several steps, from setting up your environment to running your server. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

Step 1: Install Django
pip install django

Step 2: Create a Django Project
django-admin startproject myproject

Step 3: Run the Development Server
cd myproject
python manage.py runserver

Step 4: Create a Django Application
python manage.py startapp myapp

Step 5: Register the Application
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'myapp',
]

Step 6: Define Models
from django.db import models

class Article(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    content = models.TextField()
    published_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

Step 7: Create and Apply Migrations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

Step 8: Create Views and URLs
from django.http import HttpResponse

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world!")

Step 9: Run the Server Again
python manage.py runserver
