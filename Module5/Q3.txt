Explain what does django-admin.py make messages command is used for?

-> The django-admin.py makemessages command in Django is used to create message files for translation, 
which are essential for internationalization (i18n) of a Django project. 
This command scans your code for translation strings (marked with special translation functions) 
and generates message files that can be translated into different languages.
