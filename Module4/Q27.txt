What is Instantiation in terms of OOP terminology?

-> In object-oriented programming (OOP) terminology, instantiation refers to the process of creating an instance of a class. 
An instance is a specific object created from a class blueprint, with its own unique attributes and methods.

When you instantiate a class, you're essentially creating a copy of that class with its own distinct set of attributes and behaviors. 
Each instance of a class has its own state (values of attributes) and behavior (methods).
