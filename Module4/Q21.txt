What are oops concepts? Is multiple inheritance supported in java

-> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", 
which can contain data (attributes or properties) and code (methods or functions). 
OOP focuses on organizing software as a collection of objects that interact with each other to perform tasks. 
Some of the key concepts in OOP are:

Classes and Objects: Classes are blueprints for creating objects. They define the properties and behaviors that objects of the class will have. 
Objects are instances of classes.

Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). 
It hides the internal state of an object from the outside world and only exposes the necessary methods to interact with the object.

Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (subclass or derived class) is created from an existing class (superclass or base class). 
The subclass inherits the properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) of the superclass and can also have its own additional properties and behaviors.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. 
It enables a single interface to represent different types or forms.

Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by hiding unnecessary details while highlighting essential features. 
In OOP, abstraction is achieved through classes and interfaces, which provide a simplified view of the underlying implementation.
