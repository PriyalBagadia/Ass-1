Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python?

-> Exception handling is a mechanism in Python for dealing with errors that occur during program execution.
In Python, errors are represented as exceptions, and they can occur for various reasons, such as invalid input, 
file not found, division by zero, etc. Exception handling allows you to gracefully handle these errors, 
prevent your program from crashing, and provide meaningful feedback to the user.
