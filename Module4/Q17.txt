When is the finally block executed?

-> The finally block in a Python try-except-finally structure is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. 
It ensures that certain cleanup tasks or actions are performed, such as closing files, releasing resources, or logging information, 
before the program exits the try block, whether an exception is raised or not.
