Explain Inheritance in Python with an example? What is init? Or What Is A Constructor In Python?

-> Inheritance in Python allows a class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass). 
This promotes code reuse and facilitates the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.

Inheritance is implemented using the syntax class SubClassName(SuperClassName):, where SubClassName is the name of the subclass and 
SuperClassName is the name of the superclass.

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

# Create instances of subclasses
dog = Dog("Buddy")
cat = Cat("Whiskers")

# Call methods of the subclasses
print(dog.name + " says: " + dog.speak())
print(cat.name + " says: " + cat.speak())
