What relationship is appropriate for Student and Person?

-> In modeling the relationship between "Student" and "Person," it's important to consider the fact that a student is a type of person. 
The appropriate relationship depends on whether you want to represent students as a distinct entity or as a subset of persons. 
Here are a few possible relationships:

Inheritance (Is-A Relationship):

Inheritance represents an "is-a" relationship, where one class (subclass) is a specialized version of another class (superclass).
In this relationship, the "Student" class would inherit from the "Person" class, indicating that a student is a type of person.
Example: class Student(Person)
Composition or Aggregation (Has-A Relationship):

Composition or aggregation represents a "has-a" relationship, where one class contains or is associated with another class.
In this relationship, the "Student" class may contain a reference to an instance of the "Person" class as one of its attributes.
Example: class Student: person = Person()
No Explicit Relationship:

If you don't want to represent students as a distinct entity or as a subset of persons, you may choose not to establish an 
explicit relationship between "Student" and "Person."
In this case, both "Student" and "Person" could be separate classes with no inheritance or association between them.
Example: class Student and class Person are independent of each other.
