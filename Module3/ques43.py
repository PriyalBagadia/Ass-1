# Why Do You Use the Zip () Method in Python?
# Zip() method in Python is used to combine multiple iterables (lists, tuples, etc.) element-wise. 
# It returns an iterator of tuples where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the input iterables. 
# In simpler terms, it pairs corresponding elements from multiple sequences.
